\title{\textbf{Math Parser and Evaluator}}
\author{Nicholas Esposito \and Stephen Iskander}

\maketitle

\section{Project Description}
Our project parses mathematical expressions and evaluates them symbolically in a few mathematical fields including algebra, calculus, and matrix algebra.
If the expression does not contain any variables, it will be evaluated to a numerical answer.
The user interacts with a simple JavaFX GUI by typing expressions with variables into an input field.
The answer will be printed in a command-line-like text area above the input field also showing the history of inputs and outputs.

\subsection{Stretch Goals}
The user can also use the program to graph functions.
Graphs are located on a separate tab.
The graph will be displayed next to the list of functions.
