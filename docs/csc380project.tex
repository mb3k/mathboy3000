\section{Project Description}
Our project is an expression calculator and equation solver.
The user can input mathematical expressions (e.g. \code{4*2+1}) to be evaluated to a numerical answer.
Expressions can also contain matrices or calculus operations such as integrals and derivatives.
If an expression contains one or more variables it will be simplified in terms of the variables (e.g. \code{(1*2)*x+(4-7) -> 2x-3}).
If the user inputs an equation containing a single variable, the program will solve for that variable.
The user can also input a system of equations that the program will solve if possible.

\par The program uses JavaFX for its user interface.
The main window is a simple command-prompt-like interface that the user types expressions or equations into.
Expressions are typed into a text field at the bottom of the window, and the expression as well as its evaluated answer are displayed in a text area above the input field.
The user can see their history in the output area so they can easily copy and paste previous expressions.
An additional window allows the user to graphically build matrices that will be inserted into the input field.
Systems of equations are handled on a separate tab to simplify inputting multiple equations.

\subsection{Stretch Goals}
The user can also use the program to graph functions.
Graphs are located on a separate tab.
The user inputs functions into an expandable list of functions and can choose what functions are visible on the graph.
A graph of all the visible functions is displayed next to the list of functions.
The window size and scale of the graph can be set manually or the program can attempt to set appropriate values.
